ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

Goals:
- Reduce the scrolling I do day to day by trying to write a program to do it for me.
- Potentially build a community around various topics
- Possibly ends up looking like a kind of meta news aggregator?
- I'd like to get it to the point where I can force myself to use communal anytime I have an urge to consume news or social media, and shape my consumption through modifying this platform instead of being suject to all the other platforms.
