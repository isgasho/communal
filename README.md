# Communal

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

## Goals

- Reduce the scrolling I do day to day by trying to write a program to do it for me.
- Potentially build a community around various topics
- Possibly ends up looking like a kind of meta news aggregator?
- I'd like to get it to the point where I can force myself to use communal anytime I have an urge to consume news or social media, and shape my consumption through modifying this platform instead of being suject to all the other platforms.

## Roadmap

### Version 1:

- `communal discover "$LINK"` will crawl news aggregators and various sources and accumulate interesting details about the link, its contents, commentary, and tangentially-related links.

### Someday:

- `communal serve` will serve a community web app for submitting interesting links and crawling tangential details about them, surfacing into a daily/weekly static newsletter.
